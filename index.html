              <p class="mb-5">The degrees of wikipedia project was initially inspired by online games that ask: “How many clicks does it take to get from one article on wikipedia to another?” After realizing that was a simple softest path graph algorithm, I decided that I should see if this could be turned into a simple web app with good user interface. I started by downloading the Wikipedia Graphical database dump which contained about 45Gb of XML files, which were then parsed and inserted into a Neo4j Graphical Database. From there with the database running and currently at about 14Gb in size, I created a simple PHP app that queried the server when a user searched the text, and returned results matching that search, then on form submit the application finds the shortest path between two articles and returns it as a list of cards on the page.</p>

              <p class="mb-5">The Twitter stock market project was conceived by seeing fake “economies” spring up on the internet as a joke for people guessing what the next big meme format would be. I decided that we would run a fictional stock market based on the usage and popularity of Twitter hashtags that users could bet fictional money on. The backend was achieved by using the Twitter Streaming API that allowed 1% of all tweets in the US to be streamed, parsed, and inserted into a MySql database, and exposed via a REST API created in a PHP framework called Lumen. The frontend was actually an Android Mobile app that made API calls to our backend. It was a great experience overall and gave me much experience into team development and working with large datasets.</p>

The goal of the assignment was to create a rover that could be remotely controlled by the team, and was able to sense its environment, and solve an obstacle course, without any member of our team using any of their senses. The Roomba had several sensors attached to it that fed raw data into a program that would interpret that the robot was seeing, and display it in a nice GUI on our screen (The GUI portion was extra credit). Our Roomba successfully navigated the obstacle course on its first official run and was a complete success, actually finishing several minutes below the time limit.</p>

In order to raise funds and awareness, the organization hosts interactive events at college football games called CowChips4Charity. The CowChips4Charity event is a modern version of cow chip bingo. Currently, the CowChips4Charity event is operated manually and is executed without leveraging any technologies. Our team believe the development of a web application interface for this event will increase the amount of participants and resulting donations that the Boo Radley Foundation will receive. 
Our team will develop a cross platform web application for the CowChips4Charity event to be used during collegiate sporting events and possibly professional sporting events in the future. The web application will provide an efficient way for sporting event attendees to participate in the cow chip bingo game. Users will be able to sign in via Facebook, Google, or as a guest. Once the user is signed in, they will then be able to select the sporting event they are attending and the team they are supporting. The user will be able to acquire square(s) for the cow chip bingo game through a donation via credit card. The selection of square(s) can be done well in advance of the game. Users who select the winning square for their sporting event will be notified via text message and will then receive a prize in the mail.</p>

              <p class="mb-5">Software reuse is the foundation of efficient, safe, and verifiable programming. Breaking up code into modules or functions was one of the main benefits of human readable programming languages such as Fortran and C. This allowed common code to be written once and used in multiple places, and if there was a bug in that area it would only need to be updated once to take effect everywhere. The open source software movement originally popularized by the Linux operating system and the modules that were available to extend the operating system, took software reuse to a whole new level. The Linux operating system introduced dependency management that allowed common parts of multiple computer programs to be broken into dependencies that all programs could use. This model eventually led to every programming language having a dependency manager with JavaScript currently having the largest repository of open source software with the Node Package Manager (npm). The Node Package Manager currently has over 350,000 open source packages with more being added every day. The open source software movement has created several ethical and legal dilemmas that organizations have had to grapple with over the last several decades. However, those cannot be the focus of this essay which will focus on ethical dilemmas dealing with the reuse of an author’s own software. 
  The case for reusing one’s software is extremely strong. It can be automatically assumed that a person owns the intellectual property of their own code. A good example of an ethical dilemma where we can ignore that assumption is if you as a programmer were to change jobs but still be working on similar systems/technologies. If you were to reuse code from the old job to better the new job that would be considered a theft of intellectual property since you were under contract from the old company to right that software, you forfeited your right to claim the intellectual property. Other ethical dilemma that could arise from the reuse of software would be reusing software from a non-safety critical system in a safety critical system without proper testing. This could very well end up causing errors in the system without thorough testing that could lead in the injury or death of people using the software system.</p>

              <p class="mb-5">My current short term goal is to find full time employment in a role that offers engineering experience that will allow me to grow my technical skills and contribute to an organization in a real and tangible way. I want an environment that offers completable tasks in a short amount of time allowing me to get a wide variety of experiences and problems. My long term goals is to eventually move to a leadership and management position whether that be a team lead for a specific product or some kind of department. This will allow me to leverage my business and communication skills to the betterment of my career.
My general electives gave a base to start forming the soft skills necessary in any engineering role such as written and spoken communication through reports and presentations. Additionally, these classes gave a more holistic view of education such as debate, subjective analysis of data, and world perspectives. General Education classes help engineers to think about a problem by allowing for a general framework of soft skills that can become important to solve many engineering problems such as written communication. Often times the solving of the technical aspect of an engineering problem is less tan 10% of the problem. Engineering need to gather consensus, analyze the impact of the changes upon other parts of the system, and communicate these changes to all other engineers in the organization. This “hidden part of the iceberg” is one that many engineers struggle with as they want to only focus on the technical aspects of a problem.
Overall General Education should provide a base of knowledge that are general and not specific and relate to skills that every individual in society should have such as the ability to analyze and discuss political topics in a constructive manner, view large scale economics, see how the human race went from foragers, to building empires, to the creation of the modern world which allows people to examine current issues as just an extension of past problems. Overall these skills are invaluable and should be taught to all individuals to help society be literate enough to solve problems constructively.</p>

</li>

<li>Formulate and solve engineering problems?


<ul>
<li>Throughout the degree program classes presented projects that aimed to solve an engineering problem. These projects were often designed for working in groups and solving real world challenges. </li></ul>
</li>

<li>Impact engineering solutions in a global/societal context? 


<ul>
<li>Several classes have made note and had topics covering ethical software development and the impacts of software being used for harm. Frankly, I believe that if anyone reads the news they can see just in the past year the problems that large tech companies have had with security and privacy. </li></ul>

</li>

<li>Recognize contemporary issues?


<ul>
<li>Many of the general education requirements create a strong base to examine issues that exist in society outside of my area of study, and how my area of study impacts those issues. </li></ul>

<p>Absolutely, frankly a computer science or software engineering curriculum’s job is not to teach you all the necessary technologies and frameworks, it is to teach you how to go about building software and providing frameworks to learn new technologies. So to answer the question yes I have absolutely had to draw upon lessons and experiences while working on open ended team projects. </p>

<p>My time in a fraternity taught me invaluable leadership and people skills to deal with complicated issues such as disagreements and organizing large scale projects/teams all working towards a common goal. Additionally, the organization taught me that so much more goes into a career than what one learns in school alone. Adopting a growth mindset and constantly looking to learn is the only way to succeed in the current career environment and looking into the future. </p>

<p>I would be more vocal about the parts of the program that are incredibly important in hindsight, but got glossed over or explained improperly. The best example of this would be 311 algorithms which are vital for technical interviews. I wish that the course was more practical than theoretical and that it was taught better. Frankly I did not get anything out of the lectures and much of the learning that I did for that course I took away from external resources. Being more vocal and understanding what is /isn’t important allowing me to focus my own personal studies is something that I wish I had learned earlier and put more of a focus on. </p></p>
